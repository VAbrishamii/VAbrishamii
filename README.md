## About Me

Hello! I'm Vahideh, a passionate Front-end Developer based in the beautiful country of Norway. Currently, I'm honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in Front-end Development at Noroff Higher Vocational College.

With background as an IT Administrator and Network specialist, I've gathered extensive experience over the years. Now, I'm thrilled to channel that experience into the world of coding and web development. I love creating intuitive and visually appealing web interfaces that provide great user experiences.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the scenic landscapes of Norway or diving into the latest tech trends. I'm always excited to learn new things and take on new challenges in the ever-evolving field of front-end development.ðŸ’»
